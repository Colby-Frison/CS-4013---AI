# Enhanced Core Topics Summary: AI Algorithms and Fundamentals

## Module 1: Introduction to AI

### What is AI?
AI is fundamentally the pursuit of creating systems that operate rationally and intelligently. The field is often framed around four key goals:
1.  **Thinking Humanly (Cognitive Science):** Modeling the human mind through introspection and psychological experiments.
2.  **Acting Humanly (The Turing Test):** Creating machines that can pass the Turing Test by exhibiting human-like conversational behavior.
3.  **Thinking Rationally ("Laws of Thought"):** Using formal logic and rigorous reasoning systems to build intelligent programs.
4.  **Acting Rationally (Rational Agent Approach):** Creating systems that act to achieve the best expected outcome, regardless of whether their thought process is human-like. This is the dominant approach in modern AI.

### Intelligent Agents
An **Intelligent Agent** is a system that perceives its **environment** via **sensors** and acts upon that environment using **actuators**. The design of an agent is defined by its function, measured by its ability to select the best action based on an internal **performance measure**.

A key tool for defining an agent is the **PEAS framework**:
* **P**erformance Measure (e.g., fuel efficiency, safety).
* **E**nvironment (e.g., roads, traffic, pedestrians).
* **A**ctuators (e.g., steering, accelerator, horn).
* **S**ensors (e.g., cameras, GPS, radar).

Agents are categorized by complexity, from **Simple Reflex Agents** (act based only on the current percept) to **Model-Based Reflex Agents** (maintain internal state) to **Goal-Based Agents** (use state to find a path to a desired goal) and finally **Utility-Based Agents** (act to maximize their expected happiness/utility).

***

## Module 2: Idealized Searches (Problem Solving)

### Problem Formulation
Before search begins, the problem must be formalized using a **State-Space Search** model, defined by:
1.  **Initial State:** Where the agent starts.
2.  **Actions (Successor Function):** The available moves from a state.
3.  **Transition Model:** A description of what a move does to the state.
4.  **Goal State:** The condition that defines a solution.
5.  **Path Cost:** The measure of the cost (time, steps, resources) of a sequence of actions.

### Uninformed Searches
Also known as blind searches, these algorithms have **no knowledge** of the goal state other than how to check if a state is the goal. They explore the search space systematically.

* **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Expands all nodes at the present depth level before moving to the next level. It is **complete** (guaranteed to find a solution if one exists) and **optimal** (finds the shallowest path), but requires large memory for deep or wide trees.
* **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Expands one branch as far as possible before backtracking. It is memory-efficient but is **not optimal** and is **incomplete** if a path has infinite depth.
* **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS):** Combines the benefits of BFS and DFS by conducting a series of depth-limited DFS searches, increasing the depth limit each time. It is **complete** and **optimal** like BFS, while being memory-efficient like DFS.

### Informed Searches
These searches use a **heuristic function** $h(n)$ to estimate the cost from the current state $n$ to the goal.

* **Greedy Best-First Search:** Expands the node closest to the goal, as estimated by $h(n)$. It is **not optimal** and is **incomplete**.
* **A\* Search:** The most widely used optimal search algorithm. It evaluates nodes using $f(n) = g(n) + h(n)$, where $g(n)$ is the cost from the start to $n$, and $h(n)$ is the estimated cost from $n$ to the goal. A\* is **optimal** and **complete** if the heuristic function $h(n)$ is **admissible** (never overestimates the cost to the goal) and **consistent**.

***

## Module 3: Search in the Real World (Optimization)

### Local Search
Local search techniques are designed for **optimization problems** where the goal is to find a configuration or state that maximizes a cost function, and the path taken is irrelevant.

* **Hill-Climbing:** Iteratively moves toward a neighbor state that increases the value of the objective function (or decreases the cost). Its main limitation is getting stuck in **local optima** (or local maxima/minima), where any neighboring state is worse, but the global best state has not been reached.
* **Simulated Annealing:** A technique inspired by metallurgy. It allows for "downhill" moves (moving to a worse state) with a small probability. This probability is controlled by a "temperature" parameter that gradually decreases over time (the annealing schedule), allowing the search to **escape local optima**.

### Evolutionary Search
This includes **Genetic Algorithms (GAs)**, which are a class of search and optimization algorithms inspired by biological evolution.
* A **population** of candidate solutions (individuals) is maintained.
* Solutions are evaluated via a **fitness function**.
* New generations are created using **selection** (favoring fitter individuals), **crossover** (combining features of two parents), and **mutation** (random alteration of features) to find increasingly better solutions.

### Particle Filtering
A technique used for **tracking objects** and **estimating the state** of a dynamic system (like an agent or object) over time when observations are noisy or uncertain. It uses a set of random samples (particles) to represent the probability distribution of the object's current state, which is updated over time based on new sensor data and the system's motion model.

***

## Module 4: Game Searches

### Minimax Search and Alpha-Beta Pruning
These are foundational algorithms for finding the **optimal move** in turn-based, two-player, zero-sum games (like Chess or Tic-Tac-Toe), assuming the opponent also plays optimally.
* **Minimax:** The core idea is that the *Maximizing* player wants to choose a move that maximizes their payoff, assuming the *Minimizing* opponent will always choose a move that minimizes that payoff.
* **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** An optimization of Minimax. It eliminates branches of the search tree that can be proven to not contain the optimal solution, significantly speeding up the search time without sacrificing optimality.

### Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
A highly effective search algorithm for games with large branching factors (e.g., Go, complex real-time strategy games). It relies on statistical sampling and evaluation rather than exhaustive tree enumeration. The four key phases are:
1.  **Selection:** Start at the root and select the best child node repeatedly, often using the **Upper Confidence Bound 1 applied to Trees (UCT)** formula to balance exploration and exploitation.
2.  **Expansion:** Add a new child node to the search tree.
3.  **Simulation (Rollout):** Play a random game from the new node until a result (win/loss/draw) is reached.
4.  **Backpropagation:** Update the win/loss statistics along the path from the result back up to the root.

## Module 5 & 6: Machine Learning Basics & Traditional ML

### Introduction to ML & Training
Machine learning is about building a **model** that can generalize patterns from **data**.
* **Training:** The process of optimizing the model's parameters using a **training dataset**.
* **Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance on unseen data (the **test set**) to ensure it can generalize. Key concepts include **Bias** (the model's assumptions), **Variance** (sensitivity to training data), and the **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**.
* **Overfitting:** When a model performs exceptionally well on training data but poorly on new data.
* **Cross-Validation:** A technique to evaluate a model's performance by splitting the training data multiple times to get a more robust estimate.

### Regression
A **supervised learning** task that predicts a **continuous output value** $y$ given input features $\mathbf{x}$.
* **Linear Regression:** Fits a straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) to the data to minimize the **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)**, using methods like the **Least Squares Method** or **Gradient Descent**.

### Clustering and Nearest Neighbors
* **Clustering (Unsupervised):** Grouping similar data points together. **K-Means Clustering** is a popular algorithm that iteratively assigns data points to one of $K$ cluster centers and then re-calculates the centers.
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) (Supervised):** A non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. A data point is classified by the majority vote of its $K$ nearest neighbors.

### Decision Trees
A supervised learning method that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences.
* Nodes represent tests on an attribute, branches represent the outcome of the test, and leaves represent the decision (the class label or value).
* Trees are constructed by recursively selecting the attribute that provides the greatest **Information Gain** (using entropy) or minimizes **Gini Impurity**, which quantifies the heterogeneity of the distribution.

### Ensembles
Methods that combine the predictions of multiple individual models (weak learners) to achieve better overall performance (a strong learner).
* **Random Forests:** An ensemble of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and features.
* **Boosting (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting):** Sequentially builds models, where each new model attempts to correct the errors of the previous ones.

***

## Module 7: Reinforcement Learning (RL)

### Markov Decision Process (MDP)
RL problems are formally modeled as an **MDP**, defined by a set of states ($S$), actions ($A$), a transition probability function ($T$), and a reward function ($R$). The goal is to find an optimal **Policy** ($\pi$) that maximizes the expected cumulative discounted reward.

### Temporal Difference (TD) Learning
A model-free RL approach that learns from experience without a model of the environment's dynamics. It updates the value function based on the difference between successive predictions (the temporal difference).
* **Q-Learning:** An **off-policy** TD algorithm that learns the optimal action-value function, $Q(s, a)$, which is the expected return for taking action $a$ in state $s$.
* **SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action):** An **on-policy** TD algorithm that learns the Q-function based on the agent's current policy.

***

## Module 8: Deep Learning

### Neural Networks (NNs)
NNs are composed of layers: an **input layer**, one or more **hidden layers**, and an **output layer**.
* **Perceptrons:** The basic building block, a linear classifier.
* **Activation Functions (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid):** Introduce non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn complex, non-linear mappings.
* **Deep Learning:** Refers to NNs with multiple hidden layers, enabling them to automatically learn hierarchical features from raw data.
* **Backpropagation:** The core algorithm used to efficiently calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights, which are then updated using **Gradient Descent** (or its variants like Adam) to minimize the error.

### Convolutional Networks (CNNs)
A specialized type of NN primarily used for processing grid-like data, such as images.
* Key features are the **Convolutional Layer** (applies filters to capture spatial hierarchies), the **Pooling Layer** (downsamples the output for computational efficiency and invariance), and the fully connected layers.

### Generative AI
A rapidly evolving field focused on creating models that can generate new data instances.
* **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Built on the **Transformer** architecture, these models (like GPT) excel at understanding and generating human-like text by predicting the next token in a sequence.
* **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Composed of two NNs, a **Generator** and a **Discriminator**, trained in competition. The Generator creates new data, and the Discriminator tries to distinguish real data from generated data, leading to increasingly realistic outputs.
* **Diffusion Models:** A class of models that generate high-quality images by learning to reverse a gradual process of adding noise to an image.

## Ethics and Responsible AI (Cross-Cutting Content)

A crucial element of this course is the ethical and responsible use of AI, which is covered within every module. Key considerations include:
* **Bias and Fairness:** Identifying and mitigating biases (e.g., in training data) that lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.
* **Transparency and Explainability (XAI):** Ensuring that the decision-making process of an AI system is understandable by humans.
* **Accountability:** Establishing clear responsibility for the outcomes and potential harm caused by deployed AI systems.
* **Safety and Robustness:** Ensuring AI systems operate reliably, securely, and safely in the real world.
