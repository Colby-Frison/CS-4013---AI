# Module 0: Getting Started

## Overview
Module 0 provides the foundational orientation for the AI course, covering essential non-technical aspects that support successful learning. While this module doesn't introduce AI algorithms or concepts, it establishes the framework for effective learning throughout the course.

## Course Structure and Navigation

### Website Organization
The course is organized into a web-based learning environment that provides:
- **Modular Structure**: Content is divided into distinct modules, each focusing on a specific AI topic area
- **Topic-Based Learning**: Each module contains multiple numbered topics (T1, T2, T3, etc.)
- **Multimedia Resources**: Combination of text, videos, slides, and interactive elements
- **Project Integration**: Practical assignments tied to theoretical concepts

### Navigation Best Practices
- Follow the sequential order of modules for optimal understanding
- Complete all topics within a module before moving to the next
- Use the schedule pages to track deadlines and pacing
- Bookmark important pages for quick reference

## Learning Strategies

### Effective Online Learning

**Active Engagement**
- Take notes while watching lectures and reading materials
- Pause videos to work through examples independently
- Ask questions in forums or office hours when concepts are unclear
- Relate new concepts to previous knowledge

**Self-Paced Management**
Online courses require more self-discipline than traditional classes:
- Set a regular schedule for course work
- Create a dedicated study space free from distractions
- Use the course schedule to plan ahead
- Don't fall behind—catching up is harder in self-paced formats

**Resource Utilization**
- Review slides before and after video lectures
- Use the textbook for deeper understanding of topics
- Revisit earlier modules when needed for prerequisite knowledge
- Leverage online communities and discussion forums

### Time Management

**Planning and Scheduling**
AI coursework typically includes:
- **Lectures/Reading**: 2-4 hours per module
- **Programming Assignments**: 5-10 hours per assignment
- **Written Work**: 2-4 hours per assignment
- **Project Work**: Varies significantly based on complexity

**Time Management Techniques**
1. **Time Blocking**: Schedule specific times for course work
2. **Break Down Tasks**: Divide large assignments into smaller, manageable pieces
3. **Use Deadlines**: Work backwards from due dates to create milestones
4. **Buffer Time**: Always allocate extra time for debugging and unexpected issues
5. **Prioritization**: Focus on understanding core concepts before moving to applications

**Avoiding Procrastination**
- Start assignments early to identify difficulties
- Work on the hardest parts first when mental energy is highest
- Use the Pomodoro Technique (25-minute focused work sessions)
- Reward yourself after completing milestones

### Growth Mindset

**Fixed vs. Growth Mindset**
- **Fixed Mindset**: "I'm not good at programming/math, so I can't do AI"
- **Growth Mindset**: "I can learn AI concepts and improve my skills with practice"

**Applying Growth Mindset to AI**
AI combines multiple challenging domains (math, programming, problem-solving), making growth mindset essential:

1. **Embrace Challenges**: Difficult problems are opportunities to learn
2. **Persist Through Obstacles**: Debugging and failed attempts are part of the process
3. **Learn from Criticism**: Use feedback to improve understanding and implementation
4. **Find Inspiration in Others' Success**: If they can learn it, so can you

**Practical Application**
- When stuck on a concept, break it down further or find alternative explanations
- View errors and bugs as learning opportunities, not personal failures
- Celebrate small victories and incremental progress
- Seek help when needed—it's a sign of commitment, not weakness

## Course Logistics

### Assessment Structure
Typical AI course assessment includes:
- **Programming Assignments**: Implementation of algorithms (30-40%)
- **Written Assignments**: Theoretical problems and analysis (20-30%)
- **Projects**: Larger-scale applications of AI techniques (20-30%)
- **Exams/Quizzes**: Testing conceptual understanding (10-20%)
- **Ethics Discussions**: Reflection on responsible AI (5-10%)

### Prerequisites
Strong foundation in:
- **Programming**: Proficiency in Python (or ability to learn quickly)
- **Mathematics**: Linear algebra, calculus, probability/statistics basics
- **Data Structures**: Understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms

### Tools and Software
Common tools used in AI courses:
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code, or similar IDEs
- **Version Control**: Git for managing code and collaboration

### Academic Integrity
AI courses present unique integrity challenges:
- Understanding vs. copying code from online sources
- Proper use of AI assistants (like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT)
- Collaboration boundaries on group vs. individual assignments

**Best Practices**:
- Always understand code you submit, even if you found help online
- Cite sources and collaborators appropriately
- Use AI tools for learning and explanation, not just answer generation
- When in doubt, ask the instructor about acceptable practices

## Setting Yourself Up for Success

### Technical Setup
1. **Development Environment**: Set up Python environment early
2. **Backup Strategy**: Use cloud storage or Git for all work
3. **Testing Framework**: Learn to write and run tests for your code
4. **Documentation Habits**: Comment code and maintain notes as you go

### Study Habits
1. **Consistency**: Study regularly rather than cramming
2. **Active Learning**: Implement algorithms yourself, don't just read about them
3. **Teach Others**: Explaining concepts solidifies understanding
4. **Connect Theory to Practice**: Always ask "When would I use this?"

### Building Intuition
AI concepts often seem abstract initially:
- **Visualize**: Draw diagrams of algorithms in action
- **Simplify**: Test algorithms on small, simple examples first
- **Compare**: Relate new concepts to familiar ideas
- **Experiment**: Modify parameters and observe effects

## Looking Ahead

### Course Trajectory
The course follows a logical progression:
1. **Search and Optimization**: Problem-solving fundamentals
2. **Games**: Adversarial search and strategic reasoning
3. **Learning**: Machine learning fundamentals
4. **Deep Learning**: Advanced neural network techniques
5. **Applications**: Real-world AI systems

### Skills You'll Develop
