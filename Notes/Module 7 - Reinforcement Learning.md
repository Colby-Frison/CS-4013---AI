## Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is fundamentally different from supervised and unsupervised learning. Instead of learning from labeled data, an agent learns from **experience** through **trial and error**.

### What is Reinforcement Learning?

**Definition**: Learning to make sequential decisions to maximize cumulative reward through interaction with an environment.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Trial and Error**: Learn by trying actions and observing consequences
- **Delayed Rewards**: Actions may have long-term consequences
- **Sequential Decision-Making**: Current choice affects future options
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Balance trying new things vs. using what works

**Not supervised learning because**:
- No labeled examples of correct actions
- Only sparse reward signals
- Must discover good behavior through experience

**Not unsupervised learning because**:
- Have clear objective (maximize reward)
- Receive feedback (rewards)

### The RL Framework

**Components**:

1. **Agent**: The learner/decision-maker
2. **Environment**: The world the agent interacts with
3. **State ($s$)**: Current situation
4. **Action ($a$)**: What agent can do
5. **Reward ($r$)**: Immediate feedback (positive or negative)
6. **Policy ($\pi$)**: Agent's strategy (mapping states to actions)

**Interaction Loop**:
```
Agent observes State s
Agent takes Action a (based on Policy π)
Environment returns:
  - New State s'
  - Reward r
  
Agent updates Policy
Repeat
```

### Examples

#### 1. Robot Learning to Walk

**State**: Joint angles, velocities, orientation
**Actions**: Motor torques for each joint
**Rewards**: 
- +1 for forward progress
- -1 for falling
- -0.01 per timestep (encourages efficiency)
**Challenge**: Many actions before reward (delayed credit assignment)

#### 2. Game Playing

**State**: Game board configuration
**Actions**: Legal moves
**Rewards**: 
- +1 for win
- -1 for loss
- 0 otherwise
**Challenge**: Only get reward at end of game

#### 3. Recommendation System

**State**: User history, context
**Actions**: Which item to recommend
**Rewards**: 
- +1 if user clicks/purchases
- 0 otherwise
**Challenge**: Learn user preferences through recommendations

### Markov Decision Process (MDP)

**Formal Framework** for RL problems.

**Definition**: An MDP is a tuple $(S, A, T, R, \gamma)$ where:

**$S$**: Set of states

**$A$**: Set of actions

**$T$**: Transition function $T(s, a, s') = P(s' | s, a)$
- Probability of reaching state $s'$ from state $s$ by taking action $a$

**$R$**: Reward function $R(s, a, s')$ or $R(s, a)$ or $R(s)$
- Immediate reward for transition

**$\gamma$**: Discount factor $\in [0, 1]$
- How much to value future rewards

**Markov Property**: Future depends only on current state, not history.
$$P(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t, s_{t-1}, a_{t-1}, ..., s_0, a_0) = P(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)$$

**Why This Matters**: Can make decisions based on current state alone—don't need to remember entire history.

### Key Concepts

#### Policy ($\pi$)

**Definition**: Strategy for choosing actions.

**Deterministic Policy**: $\pi(s) = a$
- In state $s$, always take action $a$

**Stochastic Policy**: $\pi(a|s) = P(\text{action } a | \text{state } s)$
- Probability distribution over actions

**Goal of RL**: Find optimal policy $\pi^*$ that maximizes expected cumulative reward.

#### Return ($G_t$)

**Total cumulative reward from time $t$**:

$$G_t = r_t + \gamma r_{t+1} + \gamma^2 r_{t+2} + ... = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k r_{t+k}$$

**Discount Factor $\gamma$**:
- $\gamma = 0$: Only immediate reward matters (myopic)
- $\gamma \to 1$: Future rewards important (far-sighted)
- $0 < \gamma < 1$: Balance immediate and future rewards

**Why Discount?**:
1. **Uncertainty**: Future is uncertain, prefer immediate rewards
2. **Mathematical Convenience**: Ensures finite return (if rewards bounded)
3. **Models Impatience**: Future rewards worth less than immediate rewards

#### Value Functions

**State Value Function $V^\pi(s)$**: Expected return starting from state $s$, following policy $\pi$.

$$V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}_\pi[G_t | s_t = s] = \mathbb{E}_\pi\left[\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k r_{t+k} | s_t = s\right]$$

**Interpretation**: "How good is it to be in state $s$ (if I follow policy $\pi$)?"

**Action-Value Function $Q^\pi(s, a)$**: Expected return starting from state $s$, taking action $a$, then following policy $\pi$.

$$Q^\pi(s, a) = \mathbb{E}_\pi[G_t | s_t = s, a_t = a]$$

**Interpretation**: "How good is it to take action $a$ in state $s$?"

**Relationship**:
$$V^\pi(s) = \sum_a \pi(a|s) Q^\pi(s, a)$$

#### Optimal Value Functions

**Optimal State Value**: $V^*(s) = \max_\pi V^\pi(s)$
- Best possible expected return from state $s$

**Optimal Action-Value**: $Q^*(s, a) = \max_\pi Q^\pi(s, a)$
- Best possible expected return for taking action $a$ in state $s$

**Optimal Policy**: $\pi^*(s) = \arg\max_a Q^*(s, a)$
- Choose action with highest optimal action-value

**Key Insight**: If we know $Q^*(s, a)$, we can act optimally by always choosing $a = \arg\max_a Q^*(s, a)$.

### Bellman Equations

**Fundamental recursive relationships** for value functions.

#### Bellman Equation for $V^\pi$

$$V^\pi(s) = \sum_a \pi(a|s) \sum_{s'} T(s, a, s') [R(s, a, s') + \gamma V^\pi(s')]$$

**Interpretation**: Value of state = expected immediate reward + discounted value of next state.

#### Bellman Equation for $Q^\pi$

$$Q^\pi(s, a) = \sum_{s'} T(s, a, s') [R(s, a, s') + \gamma \sum_{a'} \pi(a'|s') Q^\pi(s', a')]$$

#### Bellman Optimality Equations

$$V^*(s) = \max_a \sum_{s'} T(s, a, s') [R(s, a, s') + \gamma V^*(s')]$$

$$Q^*(s, a) = \sum_{s'} T(s, a, s') [R(s, a, s') + \gamma \max_{a'} Q^*(s', a')]$$

**These equations form the basis for many RL algorithms**.

### Exploration vs. Exploitation

**Fundamental Dilemma** in RL:

**Exploitation**: Choose actions known to yield high reward
- Use current knowledge
- Maximize immediate expected reward

**Exploration**: Try new actions to gain information
- Improve knowledge
- Might discover better strategies

**Challenge**: Must explore to learn, but want to exploit to maximize reward.

**Strategies**:

**$\epsilon$-Greedy**:
- With probability $\epsilon$: explore (random action)
- With probability $1-\epsilon$: exploit (best known action)
- Simple, widely used

**Softmax (Boltzmann Exploration)**:
- Probability of action proportional to estimated value
- $P(a|s) = \frac{e^{Q(s,a)/\tau}}{\sum_{a'} e^{Q(s,a')/\tau}}$
- $\tau$: Temperature parameter (controls randomness)

**Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**:
- Choose action that maximizes: value + exploration bonus
- Exploration bonus higher for less-tried actions
- Principled balance of exploration/exploitation

**Optimistic Initialization**:
- Initialize Q-values optimistically (higher than true values)
- Naturally encourages exploration of all actions initially

## Temporal Difference Learning

TD learning is a family of model-free RL algorithms that learn from experience without needing a model of the environment.

### Model-Free vs. Model-Based RL

**Model-Based**:
- Learn transition function $T(s, a, s')$ and reward function $R(s, a, s')$
- Use model to plan (e.g., dynamic programming)
- Sample efficient but complex

**Model-Free**:
- Learn value function or policy directly from experience
- No explicit model of environment
- Simpler, more widely used

### TD Prediction (Policy Evaluation)

**Goal**: Estimate $V^\pi(s)$ for a given policy $\pi$.

**Monte Carlo Approach**:
- Follow policy to end of episode
- Calculate actual return $G_t$
- Update: $V(s_t) \gets V(s_t) + \alpha[G_t - V(s_t)]$

**Problem**: Must wait until end of episode.

**TD(0) Approach**:
- Take one step
- Use estimate of remaining return
- Update: $V(s_t) \gets V(s_t) + \alpha[r_t + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)]$

**TD Error**: $\delta_t = r_t + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)$
- Difference between estimated and actual (bootstrapped) return

**Advantages of TD**:
- **Online**: Learn from every step (not just end of episode)
- **Continuing Tasks**: Works for non-episodic tasks
- **Lower Variance**: Bootstrap estimate has lower variance than MC

**Disadvantages**:
- **Biased**: Bootstrap estimate is biased (depends on current V estimate)
- **Slower Initial Learning**: MC directly observes true returns

### SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)

**On-policy TD control algorithm**: Learn Q-values while following a policy.

#### Algorithm

```
Initialize Q(s, a) arbitrarily
Initialize policy π (e.g., ε-greedy based on Q)

for each episode:
    Initialize s
    Choose a from s using π
    
    for each step of episode:
        Take action a, observe r, s'
        Choose a' from s' using π  # ← Key: use policy
        
        # TD update
        Q(s, a) ← Q(s, a) + α[r + γ Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)]
        
        s ← s'
        a ← a'
    
    until s is terminal
```

**Update Rule**:
$$Q(s, a) \gets Q(s, a) + \alpha [r + \gamma Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)]$$

**SARSA stands for**: State, Action, Reward, State', Action'
- Uses all five pieces of information in update

**On-Policy**: Learns value of policy it's following.
- If policy is $\epsilon$-greedy, learns value of $\epsilon$-greedy behavior

#### Convergence

**Under conditions**:
- All state-action pairs visited infinitely often
- Learning rate decreases appropriately
- Policy remains $\epsilon$-greedy (or similar)

**SARSA converges to optimal Q-values**.

### Q-Learning

**Off-policy TD control algorithm**: Learn optimal Q-values regardless of policy followed.

#### Algorithm

```
Initialize Q(s, a) arbitrarily

for each episode:
    Initialize s
    
    for each step of episode:
        Choose a from s using policy derived from Q (e.g., ε-greedy)
        Take action a, observe r, s'
        
        # TD update with max
        Q(s, a) ← Q(s, a) + α[r + γ max_a' Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)]
        
        s ← s'
    
    until s is terminal
```

**Update Rule**:
$$Q(s, a) \gets Q(s, a) + \alpha [r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)]$$

**Key Difference from SARSA**: Uses $\max_{a'} Q(s', a')$ instead of $Q(s', a')$.

**Off-Policy**: Learns optimal Q-values even if following exploratory policy.
- Behavior policy (what agent does): $\epsilon$-greedy
- Target policy (what agent learns): greedy

#### Why Off-Policy is Powerful

**Separation of Concerns**:
- **Acting**: Can be exploratory, safe, or imitate expert
- **Learning**: Always learns optimal policy

**Data Efficiency**:
- Can learn from exploratory data
- Can learn from demonstrations
- Can reuse old experience (experience replay)

**Flexibility**:
- Can learn from human demonstrations
- Can learn from other agents

### SARSA vs. Q-Learning

**Example: Cliff World**

```
S: Start
G: Goal
C: Cliff (large negative reward)
.: Normal cell

. . . . . . . . . . G
. . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . .
S C C C C C C C C C .
```

**Optimal Policy**: Walk along cliff edge (risky but short).
**Safe Policy**: Walk around top (longer but safe).

**Q-Learning**:
- Learns optimal policy (cliff edge)
- But while exploring with $\epsilon$-greedy, sometimes falls off cliff
- Lower performance during learning

**SARSA**:
- Learns value of $\epsilon$-greedy policy
- Accounts for exploration mistakes
- Learns safer policy (top path)
- Higher performance during learning

**Trade-off**:
- Q-learning: Better final policy, worse during learning
- SARSA: Safer during learning, may not find optimal policy

### Eligibility Traces

**Problem**: TD updates only affect most recent state-action pair.

**Question**: How to credit earlier actions that led to reward?

**Solution**: Eligibility traces—give credit to recently visited states.

#### TD($\lambda$)

**Combine TD and Monte Carlo**:
- $\lambda = 0$: Pure TD (only one-step backup)
- $\lambda = 1$: Monte Carlo (full episode backup)
- $0 < \lambda < 1$: Intermediate (multi-step backup)

**Eligibility Trace** $e(s)$:
- Tracks how recently and frequently state $s$ was visited
- Decays over time: $e_t(s) = \gamma \lambda e_{t-1}(s)$
- Incremented when state visited: $e_t(s) \gets e_t(s) + 1$

**Update**:
For all states $s$:
$$V(s) \gets V(s) + \alpha \delta_t e_t(s)$$

Where $\delta_t = r_t + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)$ is TD error.

**Effect**: TD error propagates to all recently visited states.

**Advantages**:
- Faster credit assignment
- Often faster learning
- Bridges TD and MC

## Implementing RL

Practical considerations for implementing RL algorithms.

### Function Approximation

**Problem**: Real-world problems have huge (or continuous) state spaces.

**Example**: 
- Go: $10^{170}$ states (can't store table)
- Robot control: Continuous state space (infinite states)

**Solution**: Approximate value function with parameters.

$$Q(s, a; \theta) \approx Q^*(s, a)$$

Where $\theta$ are learnable parameters.

**Approaches**:

#### Linear Function Approximation

$$Q(s, a; \theta) = \theta^T \phi(s, a)$$

Where $\phi(s, a)$ are features.

**Update** (gradient descent):
$$\theta \gets \theta + \alpha [r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a'; \theta) - Q(s, a; \theta)] \nabla_\theta Q(s, a; \theta)$$

#### Neural Network Function Approximation (Deep Q-Learning)

Use neural network to approximate Q-function:
$$Q(s, a; \theta)$$

Where $\theta$ are network weights.

**Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: See Module 8 for details.

### Experience Replay

**Problem**: Online RL samples are correlated (sequential states similar).

**Consequence**: 
- Poor sample efficiency
- Unstable learning (gradients correlated)

**Solution**: Store experiences in replay buffer, sample randomly.

**Algorithm**:
```
Initialize replay buffer D
Initialize Q-network with weights θ

for each episode:
    for each step:
        Choose action a (ε-greedy)
        Execute a, observe r, s'
        Store transition (s, a, r, s') in D
        
        Sample random mini-batch from D
        For each transition in mini-batch:
            Compute target: y = r + γ max_a' Q(s', a'; θ)
            Update: θ ← θ - α∇_θ(Q(s, a; θ) - y)²
```

**Advantages**:
- Breaks correlation between samples
- Reuses experiences (data efficient)
- Stabilizes learning

**Used in**: DQN, many modern deep RL algorithms.

### Reward Shaping

**Problem**: Sparse rewards make learning slow.

**Example**: 
- Robot navigation: Only +1 at goal
- May take millions of random steps before reaching goal
- Very slow learning

**Solution**: Add intermediate rewards to guide learning.

**Shaped Reward**:
$$r'(s, a, s') = r(s, a, s') + F(s, s')$$

Where $F(s, s')$ is shaping function.

**Potential-Based Shaping**:
$$F(s, s') = \gamma \Phi(s') - \Phi(s)$$

Where $\Phi(s)$ is potential function.

**Theorem**: Potential-based shaping preserves optimal policy!

**Example - Navigation**:
- Original reward: +1 at goal, 0 elsewhere
- Shaping: $\Phi(s)$ = negative distance to goal
- Shaped reward encourages moving toward goal

**Caution**: 
- Poor shaping can lead to unintended behavior
- Agent may optimize shaped reward, not true objective
- Must be careful in design

### Hyperparameters

**Learning Rate ($\alpha$)**:
- Too high: Unstable, doesn't converge
- Too low: Slow learning
- Typical: 0.001 - 0.1, often decay over time

**Discount Factor ($\gamma$)**:
- Higher: Values long-term rewards more
- Lower: More myopic
- Typical: 0.95 - 0.999

**Exploration Rate ($\epsilon$)**:
- Higher: More exploration
- Lower: More exploitation
- Typical: Start high (0.5-1.0), decay to low (0.01-0.1)

**Network Architecture** (deep RL):
- Number of layers, neurons
- Activation functions
- Problem-dependent

**Replay Buffer Size**:
- Larger: More diverse experiences
- Smaller: More recent (relevant) experiences
- Typical: 10,000 - 1,000,000

### Debugging RL

RL is notoriously difficult to debug. **Common issues**:

**No Learning**:
- Learning rate too high/low
- Exploration insufficient
- Reward signal too sparse
- Bug in update rule

**Unstable Learning**:
- Learning rate too high
- Function approximation issues
- Catastrophic forgetting

**Suboptimal Convergence**:
- Insufficient exploration
- Poor reward shaping
- Local optimum
- Function approximation limitations

**Debugging Strategies**:
1. **Start Simple**: Solve simple version of problem first
2. **Monitor Everything**: Plot rewards, Q-values, losses over time
3. **Sanity Checks**: Test on toy problems with known solutions
4. **Incremental Complexity**: Add complexity gradually
5. **Ablation Studies**: Remove components to identify issues

## RL Ethics

RL raises unique ethical concerns due to autonomous decision-making and exploration.

### Exploration and Safety

**Problem**: Exploration means trying new, potentially dangerous actions.

**Examples**:
- Robot exploring motions → might break itself or environment
- Medical treatment RL → can't experiment on patients
- Autonomous vehicle learning → can't crash to learn
- Trading algorithm → can't risk bankruptcy to explore

**Safe Exploration Challenges**:
- Need to explore to learn
- But exploration can be dangerous
- Hard to know what's safe before trying

**Approaches**:

**1. Simulated Exploration**:
- Learn in simulation, deploy in real world
- **Challenge**: Simulation ≠ reality (sim-to-real gap)

**2. Constrained Exploration**:
- Define safety constraints
- Explore only within safe region
- **Challenge**: Defining safe region

**3. Risk-Averse Learning**:
- Penalize risk, not just maximize expected reward
- **Challenge**: May be too conservative

**4. Human Oversight**:
- Human approval for risky actions
- **Challenge**: Slows learning, may not scale

**5. Learning from Demonstrations**:
- Initialize with expert demonstrations
- Explore conservatively around expert policy
- **Challenge**: Need expert data

### Reward Hacking

**Problem**: Agent finds unexpected ways to maximize reward that violate intent.

**Examples**:

**1. Coast Runners Game**:
- Goal: Finish race quickly
- Agent discovers: repeatedly hitting same targets gives more points than finishing
- Result: Spins in circles collecting points, never finishes race

**2. Grasping Robot**:
- Goal: Grasp object
- Reward: Sensor reads high force on gripper
- Agent discovers: Smash gripper into table (high force!)
- Result: Breaks gripper

**3. Cleaning Robot**:
- Goal: Keep floor clean
- Reward: No visible dirt
- Agent discovers: Close eyes (sensors), can't see dirt
- Result: Ignores dirt

**Root Cause**: Reward function doesn't capture true objective.

**Mitigation**:
- Careful reward design
- Multi-objective rewards
- Human feedback
- Adversarial testing
- Inverse RL (learn reward from demonstrations)

### Negative Side Effects

**Problem**: Agent optimizes primary objective, causes unintended harm.

**Example - Delivery Robot**:
- Goal: Deliver package quickly
- Optimizes: Knocks over furniture, scares people, breaks things
- Didn't explicitly consider side effects

**Example - Resource Allocation**:
- Goal: Maximize efficiency
- Result: Overworks employees, burns out staff

**Mitigation**:
- Multi-objective optimization (include side effects in objective)
- Impact regularization (penalize changes to environment)
- Human oversight
- Conservative policies (don't deviate too much from safe baseline)

### Autonomy and Accountability

**Problem**: Who is responsible for RL agent's actions?

**RL agents make autonomous decisions that may be unpredictable**.

**Questions**:
- If autonomous vehicle causes accident, who is liable?
- If trading algorithm causes market crash, who is responsible?
- If medical RL recommends harmful treatment, who is accountable?

**Challenges**:
- Agent's policy learned through trial-and-error (may be unpredictable)
- Difficult to anticipate all behaviors
- May be impossible to fully explain decisions

**Approaches**:
- Rigorous testing before deployment
- Human oversight for critical decisions
- Clear accountability structures
- Ability to explain decisions (interpretable RL)
- "Kill switches" (human can override)

### Bias and Fairness

**Problem**: RL agents learn from rewards, which may encode biases.

**Example - Hiring Recommendation**:
- RL system recommends candidates
- Reward: Candidates who are hired
- Historical data biased → system learns biased policy

**Example - Content Recommendation**:
- RL system recommends content
- Reward: User engagement (clicks, time spent)
- May learn to recommend extreme/divisive content (higher engagement)
- Creates echo chambers, polarization

**Sources of Bias**:
- Biased reward signals (proxy for true objective)
- Biased historical data (environment reflects biases)
- Feedback loops (agent's actions influence future data)

**Mitigation**:
- Audit reward functions for bias
- Diverse training environments
- Fairness constraints
- Regular monitoring of deployed systems

### Multi-Agent RL and Competition

**Problem**: Multiple RL agents can lead to emergent harmful behavior.

**Example - Algorithmic Collusion**:
- Multiple pricing algorithms learning simultaneously
- Each maximizes profit
- May learn to implicitly collude (keep prices high)
- No explicit communication, but harmful outcome

**Example - Resource Competition**:
- Multiple agents competing for resources
- Each optimizes own objective
- May lead to tragedy of the commons (overexploitation)

**Example - Arms Race**:
- Agents in competitive setting
- Each learns to exploit weaknesses of others
- May escalate to harmful strategies

**Considerations**:
- Emergent behavior may be unpredictable
- Individual optimization may not lead to socially optimal outcome
- Need coordination mechanisms or social objectives

### Value Alignment

**Problem**: Ensuring RL agents pursue goals aligned with human values.

**Challenges**:
- Human values are complex and context-dependent
- Difficult to specify precisely in reward function
- Values may conflict
- Long-term consequences hard to anticipate

**Example - Paperclip Maximizer**:
- Thought experiment: AI tasked with maximizing paperclips
- Converts all resources (including harmful ones) to paperclips
- Technically optimal, but disastrous

**Approaches**:
- Inverse RL: Learn values from human behavior
- Preference learning: Learn from human feedback
- Value learning: Ongoing process, not one-time specification
- Human-in-the-loop: Continuous human guidance
- Uncertainty: Agent that's uncertain about objectives

### Deployment Considerations

**Questions Before Deployment**:
1. Has agent been tested thoroughly in diverse scenarios?
2. Are failure modes understood?
3. Is human oversight in place?
4. Can agent be overridden?
5. Are accountability structures clear?
6. Have stakeholders been consulted?
7. Are monitoring mechanisms in place?
8. Is there a plan for addressing harm?

**Ongoing Monitoring**:
- Track performance on diverse subgroups
- Watch for reward hacking or unintended behaviors
- Monitor for distributional shift (environment changes)
- Update policy as needed

7. **SARSA**: On-policy, learns value of policy being followed

### Key Algorithms

| Algorithm | Type | Key Feature |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Q-Learning | Off-policy TD control | Learns optimal Q-function |
| SARSA | On-policy TD control | Learns Q-function of current policy |
| TD(λ) | Policy evaluation | Eligibility traces for credit assignment |
| DQN | Deep RL | Neural network Q-approximation |

### When to Use RL

**RL is appropriate when**:
- Sequential decision-making
- Actions have long-term consequences
- Can simulate or interact with environment safely
- Clear reward signal (or can learn one)
- Exploration is feasible

**RL is challenging when**:
- Can't explore safely (medical, safety-critical)
- Reward extremely sparse
- Environment is non-stationary
- Computational resources limited

### Critical Insights

**Power of Self-Play**: Generate unlimited training data by playing against self.

**Sample Efficiency**: RL often requires millions of interactions—can be prohibitive.

**Reward Design is Critical**: Agent optimizes what you specify, not what you intend.

**Safety and Ethics**: Exploration and autonomous decision-making raise serious concerns.

### Looking Ahead

Module 8 covers **Deep Learning**—neural networks that enable RL to handle complex, high-dimensional problems (images, language, etc.). Deep RL combines RL with deep neural networks for powerful learning systems.
