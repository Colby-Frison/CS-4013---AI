## Structure

Overview contains the links to navigate to most of the source website, it also has a general overview of each topic, each note module goes far more in depth. I started at module 4 so 1-3 are kind of lack luster in terms of depth, but it will be better beyond that as I work through them.

### Assignments
I'll commit my past assignments but current assignment are gonna be in gitignore until after due date

- **hw1**: First homework assignment
- **hw2**: Genetic algorithms and local search implementations
- **hw4**: Fundamental machine learning implementations

### Class Resources
- **Slides**: Course presentation materials
    - directory empty since the website has all the slides broken up, and I'm not downloadin allat
- **textbook**: AI textbook...
